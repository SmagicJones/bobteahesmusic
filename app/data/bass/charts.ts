      "it can be a little bit fiddly getting these notes and I could have made an error of one semitone or fret - however you see it in the original riff.  Its a start with exploring it though - you might find a better way of doing it 😃",

      " - I don't think I would have discovered this otherwise. Its just a bit different from where I'm coming from and really made me want to know what was happening on the bass when I first heard it - again these are really just rough sketches to get you up and running playing the thing!  If you like the tune too why not give it a go!",
